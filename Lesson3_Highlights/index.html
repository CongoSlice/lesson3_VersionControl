            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A VCS, or Version Control System, is a software tool which lets teams of developers manage changes to a source code over various lengths of time. The software keeps data logs of every change made to the source code. If a mistake is found later on in the code, a web developer can go back to a previous version in order to fix the error. The VCS allows the developer to do all this, without disrupting the work flow for all other programmers working on the same project. It also allows the developer to merge older versions with new ones, or combine two similar documents made by separate programmers. This really speeds up the developing process.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a specific VCS that is extremely lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate. Also the best part about it is that it is free to use and super cheap if you want others to have access to your project as well. It is also a version control repository and Internet hosting service. GitHub allows all of the awesome features of Git along with many of its own. It’s web graphic interface is extremely helpful as you can skip the difficult task of setting up your own server. However, if this is the route you want to go it is also set up to do this.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Cloud9</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud9 is a fully functional online code editor that allows you to edit code in over 40 languages. It has a live preview button which lets the user see what their current project would look like if opened by someone. This is extremely useful as you can visualize the changes you are making to your page at the same time as you are making them. Also since it is online it is easy to connect it to GitHub so that you can edit and share files amongst your fellow programmers, as well as go through and manage many previous versions of the same file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote vs Local Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is on a remote server which all of the developers on said repository have access to it. It is basically the online repository, which allows others to connect easily and share all their files amongst themselves. A local repository resides on the user’s local machine and stays there unless uploaded. It can be edited and added to the main file at any time as soon as you have internet connection. There are two different ways to create a local repo. You can either clone an existing remote repo on your machine or just create a new one from scratch.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As I completed this lesson it really struck me how precise everything has to be in order to function. Git doesn’t work properly if even a single quotation is missing. I used the wrong SSH key and spent an hour trying to figure out why my terminal was getting the wrong publickey error. In doing this I feel as if I have gained a greater appreciation for all of the functioning programs on the internet. It is amazing how one little typo can cause an entire program to fail. In conclusion, I learned that it is vital to not only understand what you are trying to do, but communicate it correctly and effectively.</p>
